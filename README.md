## üöÄ Getting Started



1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afk-jisan/invoice-next-js.git
   cd invoice-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`  
   - Add your database URL and `AUTH_SECRET`

4. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000/seed to populate with sample data
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   ```

6. **Deploy to Vercel**
   1. **Create a Vercel account**: Go to https://vercel.com/signup, choose the free "Hobby" plan, and connect via GitHub.
   2. **Import your project**: In the Vercel dashboard, click **New Project**, select your GitHub repository, name your project, and click **Deploy**.
   3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Once deployed, navigate to the **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables** section and add the same variables from your local `.env` (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`).
   4. **Automatic Redeploys**: Every push to `main` triggers an automatic deployment. Pull requests generate instant Preview URLs for feedback and testing.
